## ctf-pwn (Python) -- 7 tools

Binary analysis and exploit development. For disassembly, ROP gadgets, and one_gadget: use `r2`, `ROPgadget`, `one_gadget` directly from bash.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pwn_triage` | Comprehensive one-shot analysis -- file type, checksec mitigations, architecture, imports/exports, sections, dangerous functions, interesting strings. |
| `pwn_pattern_offset` | Generate cyclic patterns or find crash offsets using pwntools. |
| `pwn_shellcode_generate` | Generate shellcode via pwntools shellcraft (sh, cat_flag, connect_back, execve) for amd64/i386/arm/aarch64/mips. |
| `pwn_pwntools_template` | Generate a complete pwntools exploit script skeleton (ret2win, ret2libc, format_string, shellcode) from binary analysis. |
| `pwn_angr_analyze` | Symbolic execution via angr -- auto mode finds flag-like output, find_addr reaches specific addresses, find_string matches output. |
| `pwn_libc_lookup` | Identify libc version from leaked symbol addresses via libc.rip API. Computes base address and key offsets (system, /bin/sh, hooks). |
| `pwn_format_string` | Format string exploit automation -- probe for stack offset (`find_offset`), generate arbitrary write payloads (`write`), or get a reference guide (`info`). |

## ctf-forensics (Python) -- 5 tools

File forensics and steganography. For memory dumps, use `vol` (volatility3) directly from bash.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `forensics_file_triage` | Comprehensive file analysis -- file type, EXIF metadata, binwalk signatures, interesting strings, entropy, trailing data detection. |
| `forensics_stego_analyze` | Systematic steganography analysis. Runs all applicable tools per file type: zsteg (PNG), steghide (JPEG/BMP/WAV), EXIF comments, trailing data, LSB. |
| `forensics_extract_embedded` | Extract embedded files using binwalk and foremost. Returns extracted file types, sizes, and content previews. |
